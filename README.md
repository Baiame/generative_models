# Generative Models
## Description of the project
This Deep Learning project aims to develop and test 2 generative models:
- A Variational Autoencoder (VAE)
- A Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN)

For the first part the MNIST dataset is needed https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MNIST_database and for the second the CIFAR-10 is needed (https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html).

## More details
The project is a Google Colab Notebook including all the results and images.
